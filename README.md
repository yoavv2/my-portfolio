# Project Purpose and Goals

This Project included 4 Pages:

- **Home Page** where I introduce myself.

* **Blog Index Page** where I show all the blog posts.

  - **Blog Post**

- **Projects Page** where I'm showing what Iâ€™ve been working on using github api.

# The Stack and Explanation

- Nextjs
- TypeScript
- MDX
- TailwindCSS

**Next.js** made the most sense for the web application because its Static Site Generated (SSG) and Server Side Rendered (SSR) apps,

Dynamic Routes,

Next also gave me the ability to use both client and server in the same application.

I chose **TypeScript** mainly because I wanted to learn it.

The blog is built with **MDX**, a fancier form of Markdown that allows me to insert React components.

For styling I chose **TailwindCSS** because its ease of use.
