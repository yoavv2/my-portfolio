and Projects Page Where im showing What i`v been working on

# The Stack and Explanation

**Nextjs** made the most sense for the web application because its Static site Generated(SSG) and Server Side Renderd(SSR)
apps, Dinamic Routes, Next also gave me the abuilty to use both client and server in the same application.

I chose **TypeScript** mainly because i wanted to learn it.

The blog is built with **MDX**, a fancier form of Markdown that allows me to insert React components.


 <!-- Rather of being kept in a CMS, the posts are checked into the Git repository. -->

For Styling i chose **TailwindCSS** because its easy to use.
